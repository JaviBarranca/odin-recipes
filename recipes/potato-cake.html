    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This golden potato cake is an impressive-looking alternative to your average potato bake. Cook it in a cake tin
        then slice into wedges to serve.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="ingredients" id="potato-cake">
        <li>2kg potatoes, peeled</li>
        <li>600ml cream</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1 cup grated tasty cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 180C. Line the based of a 20cm spring form tin with baking paper.</li>
        <li>Slice potatoes thinly and place in a large saucepan with cream and garlic. Season well with salt and pepper.
            Bring to the boil, reduce heat, place a lid on the saucepan and simmer for 3 minutes until potatoes are just
            tender. Use a slotted spoon to remove potatoes from cream mixture, and place in a bowl to cool enough so you
            can handle them. Reserve the cream mixture. </li>
        <li>Place a layer of potatoes in the base of the prepared tin. Sprinkle over a little cheese. Add another layer
            of potatoes, then another sprinkling of cheese. Continue layering until you have used up all the
            ingredients, finishing with a layer of potatoes. Pour over cream mixture.</li>
        <li>Bake for 45-50 minutes until golden on top. Remove from oven and allow to cool slightly, then run a knife
            around the inside of the tin and carefully release the spring and remove the tin round. Carefully slide the
            potato cake onto a serving dish. Slice and serve. </li>
    </ol>
